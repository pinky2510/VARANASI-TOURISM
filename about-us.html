        Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as <ins>KASHI</ins>) is one of the 
        oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is 
        virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature,
        who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : 
        <ins>“Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even
        than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together.</ins> ”<br>
        <br>
        The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for
        Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of 
        Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and 
        re-birth. <ins>Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati</ins>, the origins of Varanasi 
        are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash
        away the sins of mortals.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi,
        it expands to the mighty river that we know of. The city is a center of
        learning and civilization for over <ins>3000 years</ins>. With Sarnath, the
        place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment, just 10 
        km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge, philosophy,
        culture, devotion to Gods, 
        Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for centuries. Also a pilgrimage
        place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be
        the birthplace of Parsvanath, the twenty-third Tirthankar.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ins>Vaishnavism and Shaivism</ins> have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously.
        With a number of temples, Mrs. Annie Besant chose Varanasi as the home for
        her <ins>‘Theosophical Society’</ins> and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, to institute
        ‘Benares Hindu University, the biggest University in Asia. Ayurveda is said to
        be originated at Varanasi and is believed to be the basis of modern medical
        sciences such as Plastic surgery, 
        Cataract and Calculus operations. Maharshi Patanjali, the preceptor of Ayurveda
        and Yoga, was also affiliated with Varanasi, 
        the holy city. Varanasi is also famous for its trade and commerce, especially 
        for the finest silks and gold and silver brocades, since the early days.
        <br>
        <br>
        Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated
        with promotion of <ins>Spiritualism, Mysticism, Sanskrit, Yoga and Hindi</ins> 
        language and honored authors such as the ever-famous novelist Prem Chand and 
        Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called 
        as the cultural capital of India, Varanasi has provided the right platform for
        all cultural activities 
        to flourish. Many exponents of dance and music have come from Varanasi. Ravi 
        Shankar, the internationally renowned Sitar
        maestro and Ustad Bismillah Khan, (the famous Shehnai player) are all sons of
        the blessed city or have lived here for major part of their lives.
